## Web App From Scratch

#### Intro

My single page web app is about Marvel characters.

To get the marvel api, you have to create a developer account on the [marvel developer page](https://developer.marvel.com/)

#### Microlibs

I've used two microlibs in my single page web app. I used the rendering engine Transparency.js to render the HTML pages with the api data. I used the routing engine routie.js to route everything within the single page web app.
